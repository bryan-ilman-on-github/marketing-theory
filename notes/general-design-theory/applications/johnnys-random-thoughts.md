# Johnny's Random Design Thoughts and Principles

A collection of insights, observations, and principles that don't fit neatly into other documents but are too valuable to forget.

## On Creativity

- Creativity is a tool, not a goal
- The best ideas often come from combining existing concepts (see: Idea Sex)
- Constraints breed creativity; unlimited freedom breeds paralysis
- If you're stuck, steal and modify (legally)

## On Client Relationships

- Clients don't always know what they want, but they always know what they don't want
- Educate, don't condescend
- Show the data, not just the design
- Sometimes you have to design the wrong thing to show them why it's wrong

## On Design Trends

- Trends are tools, not mandates
- Using a trend because it's trendy is lazy
- Ignoring all trends makes you look dated
- The best designers use trends selectively and strategically

## On Typography

- When in doubt, use less fonts (one is often enough)
- If you're not sure about kerning, you need to learn kerning
- Hierarchy is created through size, weight, color, and spacing
- Script fonts are almost always a mistake

## On Color

- Color attracts attention; contrast creates hierarchy
- Cultural color associations matter more than you think
- If it doesn't work in black and white, color won't save it
- Your brand colors might be wrong for conversion (test it)

## On Copy

- Design doesn't fix bad copy
- Great copy can overcome mediocre design
- Read it out loud; if it sounds stupid, it is stupid
- Shorter is almost always better (but not always)

## On Feedback

- "I don't like it" is not actionable feedback
- If three people say the same thing, they're probably right
- Your mom's opinion doesn't count (unless she's the target audience)
- Design by committee produces garbage; get one decision-maker

## On Process

- If you can't explain why you made a design choice, it was probably wrong
- Mood boards are procrastination disguised as work (sometimes)
- Version control saves lives
- Document everything, especially decisions

## On Learning

- Study failures more than successes
- Steal from outside your industry
- If you're the smartest person in the room, find a new room
- Design blogs are mostly garbage; find the exceptions

## On Tools

- Master one tool deeply before learning another shallowly
- The tool doesn't matter as much as you think
- Keyboard shortcuts are the difference between junior and senior
- AI tools are assistants, not replacements (for now)

## On Business

- Free work devalues the entire industry; say no
- If you're not embarrassed by your old work, you're not growing
- Charge based on value, not hours
- Bad clients are more expensive than no clients

## On Speed

- Fast decisions are usually good decisions
- Perfection is procrastination in disguise
- Ship and iterate beats polish and delay
- If it takes more than 10 minutes to decide, you need more information

## On Intuition

- Your gut is pattern recognition from experience
- Junior designers shouldn't trust their gut; seniors earned it
- Data informs intuition; intuition generates hypotheses
- When gut and data disagree, trust data

## On Simplicity

- Simplicity is the result of hard work, not lack of it
- Every element should have a reason to exist
- "Can I remove this?" is the most important design question
- Complex problems often have simple solutions (but finding them is hard)

## On Ego

- Your design is not your baby; kill it if it doesn't work
- Being precious about your work is a junior mistake
- The best design is invisible
- If people are complimenting the design instead of using it, you failed
