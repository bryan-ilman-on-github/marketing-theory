# Design & Copy Checklist Before Johnny Sees It

Use this checklist to review your work before presenting it. If you can't check every box, be prepared to explain why.

## Strategy & Foundation

- [ ] I can clearly articulate the goal of this design
- [ ] I know exactly who the target audience is (demographics + psychographics)
- [ ] I understand the business context (pricing, competitors, margins)
- [ ] This design serves a measurable business objective
- [ ] I have researched what competitors are doing
- [ ] I have identified the key message that must be communicated

## Visual Design

### Layout & Hierarchy
- [ ] The most important element is the most visually prominent
- [ ] Visual hierarchy guides the eye in the correct order
- [ ] The layout works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] White space is used intentionally to guide attention
- [ ] The design is not cluttered

### Typography
- [ ] All text is easily readable (size, contrast, line length)
- [ ] Typography hierarchy is clear (headlines, subheads, body)
- [ ] Font choices are appropriate for the audience and brand
- [ ] There are no more than 2-3 fonts used
- [ ] Line length is optimized for readability (45-75 characters)
- [ ] Kerning and tracking are correct

### Color & Contrast
- [ ] Text has sufficient contrast against background (WCAG AA minimum)
- [ ] Color choices are intentional and appropriate for audience
- [ ] Call-to-action buttons stand out visually
- [ ] The design works for colorblind users
- [ ] Colors are consistent with brand guidelines (or deliberately aren't)

### Images & Graphics
- [ ] All images are high resolution and properly sized
- [ ] Images support the message (not just decorative)
- [ ] Faces (if used) direct attention appropriately
- [ ] Alt text is written for all images
- [ ] No stock photo clich√©s (handshake photos, fake corporate smiles)

## Copy & Messaging

### Clarity
- [ ] The headline communicates the core benefit immediately
- [ ] There is no jargon or unclear terminology
- [ ] The message can be understood at a glance (5-second rule)
- [ ] The call-to-action is specific and clear
- [ ] I removed all unnecessary words

### Persuasion
- [ ] The copy addresses audience pain points or desires
- [ ] Benefits are emphasized over features
- [ ] There is proof (testimonials, data, case studies)
- [ ] Objections are preemptively addressed
- [ ] The copy is written for the audience, not to impress the client

### Grammar & Polish
- [ ] Spelling is correct
- [ ] Grammar is correct (or deliberately broken for effect)
- [ ] Punctuation is consistent
- [ ] Capitalization follows a consistent style
- [ ] No typos (proofread at least twice)

## Technical & Functional

- [ ] All links work correctly
- [ ] Load time is acceptable (under 3 seconds)
- [ ] Forms are simple and intuitive
- [ ] The design is accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] There are no broken images or missing assets

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] I tested this on multiple browsers
- [ ] I tested this on actual mobile devices
- [ ] I showed this to someone in the target audience
- [ ] I can explain every design decision with logic or data
- [ ] If possible, I reviewed analytics or heatmaps from similar pages

## Final Questions

- [ ] Does this achieve the stated goal?
- [ ] Would I use/buy this if I were the target audience?
- [ ] Is this the simplest solution that works?
- [ ] Can I defend this design with data, not just opinion?
- [ ] Am I proud to put my name on this?

## Before Sending

- [ ] File names are organized and clearly labeled
- [ ] Version numbers are correct
- [ ] I included context/explanation in my message to Johnny
- [ ] I stated what kind of feedback I'm looking for
- [ ] I'm prepared to hear "this isn't good enough"
