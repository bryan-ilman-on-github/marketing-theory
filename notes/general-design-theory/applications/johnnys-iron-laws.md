# Johnny's Iron Laws of Design

These are non-negotiable principles that must be followed. Violate these at your own peril.

## Iron Law #1: Clarity Over Cleverness

**If the audience doesn't immediately understand, the design has failed.**

- Clever wordplay is worthless if it confuses
- Artistic expression is meaningless if the message is lost
- You are not being paid to impress other designers

## Iron Law #2: Test Everything

**Your opinion is worthless. Data is king.**

- What you think looks better doesn't matter
- What performs better matters
- A/B test whenever possible
- Track, measure, analyze, iterate

## Iron Law #3: The Audience Decides, Not You

**You are not the audience.**

- Design for their preferences, not yours
- Your taste is irrelevant
- What matters is what works for them
- Check your ego at the door

## Iron Law #4: Function Over Form

**Pretty is useless if it doesn't convert.**

- Aesthetics serve the goal, not the other way around
- If beauty reduces function, remove the beauty
- Effective ugly beats ineffective beautiful every time

## Iron Law #5: Contrast is Non-Negotiable

**If they can't read it, they can't buy it.**

- Text must be legible on all devices
- Call-to-action buttons must stand out
- Hierarchy must be immediately obvious
- Low contrast is a cardinal sin

## Iron Law #6: Respect the User's Time

**Every unnecessary element is stealing from them.**

- Remove anything that doesn't serve the goal
- Simplify, then simplify again
- Fast load times are non-negotiable
- Get to the point immediately

## Iron Law #7: Mobile First is Not Optional

**More than half your audience is on mobile.**

- If it doesn't work on mobile, it doesn't work
- Test on actual devices, not just simulators
- Thumb-friendly navigation
- Readable without zooming

## Iron Law #8: Consistency Builds Trust

**Every inconsistency makes them question your competence.**

- Typography consistency across the entire experience
- Color palette adherence
- Spacing system that's predictable
- Brand voice that never wavers

## Iron Law #9: White Space is Not Wasted Space

**Cramming more in does not increase effectiveness.**

- Breathing room improves comprehension
- White space directs attention
- Clutter kills conversion
- Less is almost always more

## Iron Law #10: You Must Understand the Business

**Designing without knowing the business goals is malpractice.**

- Know the profit margins
- Understand the customer lifetime value
- Comprehend the competitive landscape
- Design decisions must tie to revenue

## Enforcement

These are called Iron Laws because they are **non-negotiable**. If you find yourself violating one, stop and reconsider.

If Johnny sees a violation of these laws, expect immediate feedback.
