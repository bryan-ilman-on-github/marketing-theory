## Daily Learning Habits

### Habit 1: The 30-Minute Rule

Spend 30 minutes daily studying:
- Monday: Read a design article
- Tuesday: Study a great landing page
- Wednesday: Watch a marketing talk
- Thursday: Review a competitor
- Friday: Learn a new tool/technique

### Habit 2: Screenshot Everything Great

When you see excellent design:
- Screenshot it
- Note what makes it great
- Add to your swipe file
- Tag by principle demonstrated

### Habit 3: Reverse-Engineer Success

Pick one successful thing per week:
- Ad campaign
- Website
- Email
- Brand identity

Ask:
- Why does this work?
- What principle is being used?
- How can I apply this?

## Learning by Doing

### Project 1: Redesign a Bad Website

Pick a terrible website:
- Analyze what's wrong
- Create a redesign
- Document your decisions
- Post it (with before/after)

### Project 2: Copy Successful Work

Not to plagiarize, but to learn:
- Recreate a great design pixel-by-pixel
- You'll discover details you missed
- Understand why choices were made

*Note: Never publish copied work as your own*

### Project 3: Daily Design Challenge

Give yourself constraints:
- Design a mobile app screen in 30 minutes
- Write 5 headlines for a product
- Create a logo concept in 15 minutes

Speed forces you to rely on fundamentals.

## Learning from Failure

### Document Your Mistakes

Keep a "What I Learned" journal:
- What went wrong?
- Why did it fail?
- What would you do differently?
- What principle did you violate?

### Study Bad Design

Don't just study successes:
- Find terrible designs
- Analyze why they fail
- Redesign them (on paper or in your head)
- Note the principles violated

### Ask for Brutal Feedback

Find people who will be honest:
- Join design critique groups
- Post work for feedback (brace yourself)
- Ask "What's the weakest part?" not "Do you like it?"
