# Idea Sex (Creativity SOP)

The most powerful creative process is combining two or more existing ideas to create something new. This is "Idea Sex."

## The Concept

**Breakthrough ideas rarely come from nothing. They come from combining existing ideas in new ways.**

Examples:
- **Uber** = Taxi + GPS + Mobile payments
- **Airbnb** = Hotel + Peer-to-peer marketplace + Trust ratings
- **Instagram** = Photo sharing + Filters + Social network

James Altucher popularized the term "Idea Sex," but the principle is ancient.

## How to Practice Idea Sex

### Step 1: Collect Ideas Constantly

Build an "idea inventory":
- Keep a running list of concepts, techniques, and examples
- Study outside your industry
- Note what works in unrelated contexts
- Save examples of excellence

### Step 2: Define the Problem Clearly

You can't combine ideas effectively if you don't know what problem you're solving.

Ask:
- What is the specific challenge?
- What has been tried before?
- What constraints exist?

### Step 3: Force Combinations

Take two random ideas and ask: "How could these work together?"

**Exercise**: Pick two concepts from different industries and force a combination.

Example:
- Concept A: Fast food drive-through
- Concept B: Medical clinics
- Combination: Drive-through medical testing (which now exists!)

### Step 4: Evaluate and Refine

Not every combination will work. Test the logic:
- Does it solve the problem?
- Is it feasible?
- Does it provide unique value?

## Idea Sex Techniques

### Technique 1: Cross-Industry Inspiration

Look for solutions in unrelated industries:
- How does Disney handle customer experience?
- How does Amazon approach logistics?
- How does Netflix use data?

Apply those principles to your problem.

### Technique 2: Attribute Listing

List all attributes of your product/service, then swap them:
- If our service was fast food instead of consulting, what would change?
- If our website was a magazine, how would we design it?

### Technique 3: Forced Analogy

Complete this sentence: "This problem is like _____, so the solution might be _____."

Example:
- "This cluttered website is like a messy closet, so the solution might be to Marie Kondo it (keep only what sparks joy/serves a purpose)."

### Technique 4: SCAMPER Method

- **S**ubstitute: What can be replaced?
- **C**ombine: What can be merged?
- **A**dapt: What can be adjusted?
- **M**odify: What can be changed?
- **P**ut to other use: What new use could it have?
- **E**liminate: What can be removed?
- **R**everse: What can be flipped?

## Building Your Idea Library

### What to Collect

- **Marketing campaigns** that worked (and why)
- **Design patterns** from great websites/apps
- **Copy formulas** that convert
- **Business models** that scale
- **User experiences** that delight
- **Problem-solving frameworks** from any field

### How to Organize

Create a system (digital or physical):
- Notion database
- Bookmarks with tags
- Pinterest boards
- Physical swipe file

Tag by:
- Industry
- Problem solved
- Technique used
- Emotion evoked

## Idea Sex in Action: Examples

### Example 1: Landing Page Design

**Problem**: E-commerce landing page with low conversions

**Ideas Combined**:
- Magazine layout (visual hierarchy)
- Infomercial structure (problem-solution-proof-offer)
- Video game progression (small wins leading to big action)

**Result**: Landing page with editorial-style storytelling, testimonials after each objection, and micro-conversions before main CTA.

### Example 2: Email Campaign

**Problem**: Low open rates

**Ideas Combined**:
- Clickbait headlines (curiosity gap)
- Personal letter format (intimacy)
- TV cliffhangers (open loops)

**Result**: Subject lines that tease without revealing, email body that feels 1-on-1, content that promises resolution in next email.

### Example 3: Brand Identity

**Problem**: Tech startup feels too corporate

**Ideas Combined**:
- Skate culture (rebellious energy)
- Academic institutions (trust/authority)
- Game design (playfulness)

**Result**: Bold, slightly edgy visual identity with credible, well-researched content and gamified user onboarding.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Combining Random Things Without Purpose

Combining for the sake of combining produces novelty, not value.

**Fix**: Start with the problem, then seek combinations that solve it.

### Mistake 2: Only Looking Within Your Industry

If you only study design, you'll only create derivative design.

**Fix**: Study psychology, film, architecture, gaming, literatureâ€”everywhere.

### Mistake 3: Not Testing the Combination

Just because two ideas are great separately doesn't mean they work together.

**Fix**: Prototype and test before committing fully.

## Exercises to Build This Skill

### Exercise 1: Daily Idea Combinations

Each day, force yourself to combine two random concepts:
- Pick two items from your idea library
- Spend 5 minutes exploring how they could merge
- Write down the result (even if it's bad)

### Exercise 2: Industry Translation

Pick a successful example from another industry:
- Study why it works
- Translate it to your field
- Adapt it to your specific problem

### Exercise 3: Constraint Combination

Give yourself constraints and combine them:
- "Design a landing page that's like a movie trailer"
- "Write copy that sounds like a standup comedy routine"
- "Create a brand identity inspired by brutalist architecture"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Creativity is combination**, not magic inspiration
2. **Study widely**, not just deeply in your field
3. **Collect ideas obsessively** to build your inventory
4. **Force combinations** when you're stuck
5. **Test everything** - not all combinations work

**The more ideas you collect, the more combinations you can create. The more combinations you create, the more likely you are to find breakthrough solutions.**

Practice Idea Sex regularly. It's a skill, not a talent.
