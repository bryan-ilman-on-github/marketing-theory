# The Three Essential Questions to Ask Before Creating or Evaluating a Design

Before diving into any design project, it's critical to ask yourself three fundamental questions. These questions form the foundation of effective design thinking and help ensure your work serves its intended purpose.

## Question 1: What is the Goal?

Every design must have a clear, measurable objective. Ask yourself:

- What action do we want the audience to take?
- What problem are we solving?
- How will we measure success?

Without a clear goal, you're designing in the dark.

## Question 2: Who is the Audience?

Understanding your audience is paramount. Consider:

- Demographics (age, location, income, education)
- Psychographics (values, interests, pain points)
- Context (where and how will they encounter this design?)

The audience determines every design decision you make.

## Question 3: What is the Message?

Your design must communicate clearly and effectively:

- What's the single most important thing the audience should understand?
- What tone and voice are appropriate?
- How does the visual hierarchy support the message?

If the message isn't clear, the design has failed.

## Why These Questions Matter

These three questions create a framework for:

- **Alignment** - Ensuring all stakeholders are on the same page
- **Focus** - Preventing scope creep and unnecessary elements
- **Evaluation** - Providing objective criteria to assess your work

Remember: Great design is not about personal preference. It's about effectiveness in achieving the goal for the specific audience with a clear message.
