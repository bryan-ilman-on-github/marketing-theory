# Optimal Exists Master SOP List

**Core Principle**: For every design decision, an optimal solution exists based on the specific audience, goal, and context.

## The "Optimal Exists" Philosophy

Most design debates stem from arguing personal preferences instead of seeking objective effectiveness. This SOP outlines how to find optimal solutions.

## Finding the Optimal Solution

### Step 1: Define Success Metrics

Before design begins:

- What specific outcome defines success?
- How will it be measured?
- What is the baseline/control?

### Step 2: Identify All Variables

Common variables that affect optimal solutions:

- Audience demographics and psychographics
- Context (where/when/how it's seen)
- Medium (print, web, mobile, etc.)
- Goal (awareness, conversion, education, etc.)
- Brand guidelines and constraints

### Step 3: Research What Works

Look for evidence:

- **Industry benchmarks** - What conversion rates are typical?
- **Competitor analysis** - What are successful competitors doing?
- **Case studies** - What has been proven to work?
- **Testing data** - What does our own A/B testing show?

### Step 4: Apply Known Principles

Use established design principles:

- Visual hierarchy
- Contrast and readability
- Color psychology (for the specific audience)
- Spacing and white space
- F-pattern and Z-pattern scanning

### Step 5: Test and Iterate

The optimal solution is discovered through:

1. Hypothesis based on research
2. Implementation
3. Testing
4. Analysis
5. Refinement

## When "Optimal" Conflicts with "Preference"

If Johnny (or any stakeholder) says "I don't like it" but the data shows it works:

1. **Acknowledge the feedback** - Preferences matter for brand fit
2. **Present the data** - Show why this solution is optimal
3. **Seek compromise** - Can we maintain effectiveness while addressing the concern?
4. **Test alternatives** - Maybe there's a better optimal we haven't found

## Common Optimal Solutions (Based on Testing)

- **Headlines**: Curiosity + benefit usually outperforms clever wordplay
- **CTAs**: Specific, action-oriented buttons outperform vague ones
- **Images**: Faces looking at the CTA guide eye movement
- **Color**: Contrast matters more than color choice
- **Copy length**: Depends entirely on audience familiarity and ticket price

## Red Flags That You're Not Seeking Optimal

- "I like this better" (without data)
- "This is more creative" (creativity is a means, not the goal)
- "Everyone does it this way" (appeal to tradition)
- "Let's just ship it" (avoiding testing)

## The Bottom Line

Optimal exists. Your job is to find it through research, testing, and objective analysisâ€”not through personal preference or design trends.

**Question to ask**: "What evidence do we have that this is the optimal solution for our specific audience and goal?"
