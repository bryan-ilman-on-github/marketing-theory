# Who Is the Real Audience?

One of the most common mistakes in design is assuming you know who the audience is without doing the work to truly understand them.

## The Trap of Assumptions

Many designers fall into these traps:

- Designing for themselves rather than the actual audience
- Assuming the client is the audience
- Creating work to impress other designers

**The real audience is rarely who you think it is.**

## Finding the Real Audience

To identify the true audience, ask:

1. **Who makes the buying decision?** (Not always the user)
2. **Who influences the decision?** (Family, friends, experts)
3. **Who will actually use the product/service?**

### Example: Children's Toys

- **User**: The child
- **Buyer**: The parent
- **Influencer**: Both child and parent, plus reviews/recommendations

Your design must appeal to multiple stakeholders simultaneously.

## The Decision-Maker vs. The User

Sometimes the person making the decision is not the person using your product:

- **B2B Software**: IT department buys, employees use
- **Healthcare**: Doctor prescribes, patient uses
- **Education**: Administrator chooses, students/teachers use

Design must serve both, but prioritize the decision-maker if you want to make the sale.

## Audience Research Questions

Before starting any project, answer these:

- What keeps them up at night?
- What are their objections and fears?
- What language do they use?
- Where do they hang out (online and offline)?
- What do they already trust?

## The Bottom Line

You cannot design effectively for an audience you don't understand. Do the research. Talk to real people. Test your assumptions.

**The audience is not you.**
